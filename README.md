## Intro
This project aimed to predict ticket purchases and identify whether tickets would be bought on the primary or secondary market for NCAA Division I Womenâ€™s Basketball. The methodology included data exploration, feature engineering, and model building. Our final model was Gradient Boosting, which secured 8th place out of 54 teams from 4 universities. Results were visualized using Tableau to highlight key trends and the model's effectiveness in predicting ticket purchases.
